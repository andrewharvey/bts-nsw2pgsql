 CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
 SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS CC0 WAIVER DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
 RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS"
 BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION
 PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of various jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 certain exclusive rights upon the creator of an original work of authorship
 and/or a database (each, a “Work”), and the subsequent owners thereof.
 .
 Some owners of these exclusive rights wish to permanently remove these
 restrictions from a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons that the
 public can reliably build upon, modify, reuse and redistribute as freely as
 possible from such restrictions for any purposes and in any form whatsoever,
 whether modified or unmodified, in whole or in part. Such owners therefore
 wish to fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waive, abandon and
 relinquish their Copyright Related Rights (defined below) with respect to a
 Work to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
 .
 A Work associated with this CC0 Waiver may be protected by copyright and
 related or neighboring rights, database rights (such as those arising under
 Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
 implementation thereof, (including any amended or successor version of such
 directive)), and/or other similar equivalent or corresponding rights
 throughout the world as such rights may be available under applicable law or
 treaty (and national implementations thereof), including but not limited to
 moral rights retained by the original author(s), publicity and privacy rights
 pertaining to an individual’s image or likeness depicted in a Work, rights
 protecting against unfair competition in regards to the Work, and any rights
 protecting the extraction, dissemination and reuse of data in the Work (such
 rights all, collectively, the “Copyright Related Rights”).
 .
 The person associating this CC0 Waiver with a Work is the owner of Copyright
 Related Rights in the Work (the “Affirmer”), and does openly, overtly and
 voluntarily elect to apply this CC0 Waiver to his or her Work with knowledge
 of his or her Copyright Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and
 intended legal effect of this CC0 Waiver.
 .
 Subject to rights of other persons in the Work, and any patent and trademark
 rights held by Affirmer, by associating this CC0 Waiver with a Work the
 Affirmer does intend to fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally
 waive, abandon and relinquish all of his or her Copyright Related Rights in
 such Work, to the fullest extent permitted by (but not in contravention of)
 applicable law.
 .
 CC0 Waiver
 .
 1.  To the fullest extent permitted by (but not in contravention of)
 applicable law, Affirmer hereby fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 unconditionally waives, abandons and relinquishes all of Affirmer’s Copyright
 Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether present or
 future, vested or contingent, in the Work, (such waiver, abandonment, and
 relinquishment, the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of
 each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs or
 successors.
 .
 2. Should the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective
 under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent
 permitted and Affirmer hereby grants to each such affected recipient of the
 Work a worldwide, royalty-free, non exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of
 the applicable copyright), non transferable, non sublicensable, irrevocable
 and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright Related Rights in
 the Work, which license shall be deemed effective as of the date this CC0
 Waiver was applied by Affirmer to the Work.
 .
 3. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 relinquished, licensed or otherwise affected by this CC0 Waiver.
 .
 4. Affirmer hereby fully and completely disclaims responsibility for clearing
 rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any intended use
 thereof, including without limitation any such person’s Copyright Related
 Rights (including privacy and publicity rights). Further, Affirmer hereby
 fully and completely disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
 consents, permissions or other rights required for such intended use.
 .
 5. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not party to
 this CC0 Waiver and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 Waiver
 or use of the Work.
